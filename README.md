1. Project Title
Clash-Pets

📝 2. Project Description
Write a few sentences describing what your program does.
 Include:
A virtual pet in the theme of the clash royale game in which you can make your pet sleep, attack, run, and do nothing. These attributes will be able to let you bond with your pet, just like a tamagotchi! What makes our program unique is because we offer a randomized pet experience in which if they dont like thier pet they can reroll for a chance at a rarer or better pet! These pets include the Dart Goblin :50% the Hog rider
